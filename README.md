## Decision Support System
For the project of the Practical Course Information Systems course at University Stuttgart we developed a visualization for a decision support system.
The existing backend, which this project relies on is able to accurately determine faults in cells aswell as their respective probabilities through symptoms caused by sensors through bayesian networks. This system was specifically designed for the hololens 2 to aid construction workers in making decisions about faulted cells of a production line in mixed reality.

This Project was done in collaboration with https://github.com/Jasperouz and another team member during the course.
